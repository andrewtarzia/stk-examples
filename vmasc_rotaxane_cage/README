This script builds and optimizes (using MCHammer and XTBFF) an m2l4 Lantern cage from a rotaxane-based ligand (DOI: 10.1039/D0CC04780E).

There are some custom functions inside building.py.

*_bb.mol structures are the only hand built molecules (Avogadro), which building.py will load in.

IF full_ligand.mol exists (i.e. has been constructed and optimised once), then those steps will be skipped because the orientation optimisation of the initial ligand is the slowest (most naive) optimisation in this script (in function `direction`).
