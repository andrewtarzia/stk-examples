We have two scripts here:

ligand_connected.py : construct an extended model of MOCs connected via ditopic building blocks connected to the ligand backbone akin to (https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.696081)

metal_connected.py : construct an extended model of MOCs connected via ditopic building blocks connected to the axial position of the paddle wheel
    This script requires a custom paddlewheel topology.
